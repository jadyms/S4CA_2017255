Amilcar, 

All this project was developed by me - Jady Martins Silva 2017255

- There is some data in the db for testing. The init classes loads the db into the system
then all modifications are stored into the arrays
the system does not save it into the DB again

 - No validation for empty fields on the forms

- Use the"X" to close the windows. Unfortunately the "Back" button has no event listener
	
- The rental and loyalty card properties are not fully developed

-Most of the functions are in manage customer - customer controller, even the rental related ones

Thank you,
